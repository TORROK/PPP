what has been done already:

these are updated to implement the new handler registration syntax
and logic
    MethodMultiplexer.pike
    StageHandler.pike
    State.pike
    OrderedQueue.pike
    Unl.pike
    HandlingTools.pike

biggest parts that need to be done first:
    - get the storage working with signature applies. not sure right now
      how that can be done exactly. signature->apply() works, however
      there are some unresolved issues:
      - locking
      - which kind of signatures does some remote storage support and
        how to negotiate/do the rest client side
    - rewrite the current handlers
