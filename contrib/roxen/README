integrate psyc into roxen
    
    to use psyc with roxen,
    the protocols directory needs to be placed in roxen/local/protocols/
    pmods need to be linked (or copied from lib to roxen/local/pike_modules/
    include files need to go into roxen/local/include/
    handlers from contrib go into roxen/local/pike_modules/PSYCLocal.pmod
    
    roxen needs to be restarted on the command line if one of the directories in
    roxen/local did not exist previously. (restarting in the webinterface is not
    enough)
