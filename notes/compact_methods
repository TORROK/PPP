We should make some kind of survey and put together all different kinds of serialization
methods we are using right now. We might in addition add some kind of special PSYC compact
method to the Packet type to allow for compactification of vars keys, but since we make
an explicit difference between types and names (see also old discussion) this would be a
special case.

Types (PFISMA):
---------------

    _packet	p
    _float	f
    _integer	i
    _string	s
    _mapping	m
    _array	a

    _date	d
